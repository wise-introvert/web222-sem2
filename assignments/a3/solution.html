          <p>The bald eagle, which is called Haliaeetus leucocephalus in latin, is an American marine bird. Along with it's subspecies, it forms a pair with the white-tailed eagle. The majority of Canada and Alaska, as well as the whole contiguous United States and northern Mexico, are all within its range. It like to be near vast quantities of open water with plenty of food and old-growth trees to nest in.</p>

          <p>The bald eagle is called so because it get its name from the French term "piebald," which means "spotty or patchy".<figure style="float: right; width: 300px;"><img src="https://i.natgeofe.com/k/afe51970-80c6-46c3-b047-4c407c72d874/bald-eagle-closeup_4x3.jpg" style="height: auto; width: 300px; object-fit: contain;"/> <figcaption><cite>Bald Eagle by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fkids.nationalgeographic.com%2Fanimals%2Fbirds%2Ffacts%2Fbald-eagle&psig=AOvVaw0gnWBlerdUJKPuhf7R4OUU&ust=1646702484894000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CAsQjRxqFwoTCIi9-ffqsvYCFQAAAAAdAAAAABAD">National Geographic</a></cite></figcaption></figure> The heads and tails of adult eagles are covered in white feathers, which are dark brown in colour. They also have hooked yellow beaks, large talons, and small spikes on their feet called "spicules," which they use to grasp prey. 
          When eagles are young, they are known as "eaglets," and they are light grey and fluffy. When they're around 12 weeks old and ready to leave the nest, their feathers become dark brown. Their head and tail feathers will not become white until they are four or five years old.
          <br/><br/>Bald eagles live in densely wooded areas that are close to water bodies like lakes, rivers, and oceans. This geographical condition increases their chances of getting food from the water body as well as trees for nesting. Eagles, for the most part,  like regions that are isolated from human populations.<br /><br/>The bald eagle are found exclusively in the Northern regions of continent of America. The majority of Canada's bald eagle population lives near British Columbia's Pacific coast. They are also found in Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and northwestern Ontario's boreal forests. Small groups of eagles can also be seen in southern Quebec, Cape Breton, and along Newfoundland's coast. Being on top of the food chain, they have very few predators. These majestic creatures have been on the decline, mainly due to human interference in their natural habitat.

They’re able to spot small movements at well over 1km or even 2km away.<br /><br />They are opportunistic carnivorous predators and pursue practically any animal that can be reliably targeted without putting themselves in risk. This includes carrion, which is a great free diet that requires very little energy to hunt.<br /><br />Bald eagles are said to consume 400 different species, the majority of which being fish (more than half of their food on average), birds (25 percent or more of their diet on average), and mammals (15 percent or more of their diet on average), with the remainder being various prey such as lizards.</p>

            <h3 style="font-weight: 300;">National bird of United States</h3>
            <p>The bald eagle has been the national bird of the United States since 1782, when it was shown on the country's Great Seal. It can also be found in numerous federal buildings and on official documents, making it the most photographed bird in the United States. On the president's flag, the House of Representatives' mace, military insignia, and billions of one-dollar coins, the eagle appears.<br /><br />
            The bald eagle was initially used as an American symbol in 1776 on a Massachusetts copper cent. Since then, it has appeared on the reverse side of a variety of US coins, including the silver dollar, half dollar, and quarter, as well as gold coins such as the eagle, half eagle, quarter eagle, and double eagle.</p>
