            The bald eagle, which is called Haliaeetus leucocephalus in latin, is an American marine
            bird. Along with it's subspecies, it forms a pair with the white-tailed eagle. The
            majority of Canada and Alaska, as well as the whole contiguous United States and
            northern Mexico, are all within its range. It like to be near vast quantities of open
            water with plenty of food and old-growth trees to nest in.

            The bald eagle is called so because it get its name from the French term "piebald,"
            which means "spotty or patchy".

            The heads and tails of adult eagles are covered in white feathers, which are dark brown
            in colour. They also have hooked yellow beaks, large talons, and small spikes on their
            feet called "spicules," which they use to grasp prey. When eagles are young, they are
            known as "eaglets," and they are light grey and fluffy. When they're around 12 weeks old
            and ready to leave the nest, their feathers become dark brown. Their head and tail
            feathers will not become white until they are four or five years old. <br /><br />Bald
            eagles live in densely wooded areas that are close to water bodies like lakes, rivers,
            and oceans. This geographical condition increases their chances of getting food from the
            water body as well as trees for nesting. Eagles, for the most part, like regions that
            are isolated from human populations.<br /><br />The bald eagle are found exclusively in
            the Northern regions of continent of America. The majority of Canada's bald eagle
            population lives near British Columbia's Pacific coast. They are also found in Alberta,
            Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and northwestern Ontario's boreal forests. Small groups of
            eagles can also be seen in southern Quebec, Cape Breton, and along Newfoundland's coast.
            Being on top of the food chain, they have very few predators. These majestic creatures
            have been on the decline, mainly due to human interference in their natural habitat.

            Bald eagles are skilled hunters that can hover several thousand feet above their
            territories before swooping in at high speed and surprising their victim. They’re able
            to spot small movements at well over 1km or even 2km away.<br /><br />They are
            opportunistic carnivorous predators and pursue practically any animal that can be
            reliably targeted without putting themselves in risk. This includes carrion, which is a
            great free diet that requires very little energy to hunt.<br /><br />Bald eagles are
            said to consume 400 different species, the majority of which being fish (more than half
            of their food on average), birds (25 percent or more of their diet on average), and
            mammals (15 percent or more of their diet on average), with the remainder being various
            prey such as lizards.

            <p>
              The bald eagle has been the national bird of the United States since 1782, when it was
              shown on the country's Great Seal. It can also be found in numerous federal buildings
              and on official documents, making it the most photographed bird in the United States.
              On the president's flag, the House of Representatives' mace, military insignia, and
              billions of one-dollar coins, the eagle appears.<br /><br />
              The bald eagle was initially used as an American symbol in 1776 on a Massachusetts
              copper cent. Since then, it has appeared on the reverse side of a variety of US coins,
              including the silver dollar, half dollar, and quarter, as well as gold coins such as
              the eagle, half eagle, quarter eagle, and double eagle.

            <p>
              The bald eagle, like the golden eagle, is a revered bird in various North American
              civilizations, and its feathers are crucial to many religious and spiritual rituals
              among Native Americans. In certain civilizations, eagles are regarded as spiritual
              messengers between gods and mankind.<br /><br />The eagle claw is also used by many
              pow wow dancers as part of their costumes. Eagle feathers are frequently utilized in
              traditional ceremonies, particularly in the fabrication of regalia, as well as fans,
              bustles, and headdresses.<br /><br />An eagle feather is considered as protection in
              Navajo culture, and Navajo medicine men utilize the leg and wing bones for ceremonial
              whistles.
