## Abstract

The bald eagle (Latin name: Haliaeetus leucocephalus) is a bird of prey ==that lives in North America==. ==It is the national bird of the United States of America==. ==The bald eagle is a kind of sea eagle==. It can be found in most of Canada, all of the United States, and the northern part of Mexico. ==It lives near big areas of water==, where there are trees to nest in and ==there is a lot of food to eat==. It is called bald because of its white head and neck. (There is more information on the bald eagle's name in the section below called "Name.")

## Synopsis

### Young Bald Eagle on sand

When bald eagles "call,", they chirp weakly and whistle. The young birds whistle more shrilly than adults.[7].
When bald eagles live in captivity, such as in zoos, they can live much longer.[8].
This sea eagle gets both its common and scientific names from its head.
It is larger than the southern kind, leucocephalus.
It is found in the northern United States, Canada, and Alaska.[2][14] The bald eagle looks a lot like the Eurasian white-tailed eagle.
These species both have white heads of the same size, the white-tailed eagle has a more pale feather color.
The bald eagle has a name because it can reach speeds to (30)mph

### Bald eagle with a salmon

The bald eagle's natural home is in most of North America, including most of Canada, all of the United States, and northern Mexico.[18].
Bald eagles need old trees with hard wood to live, sleep, and make nests.
They like trees that have holes and are safe from predators.
Bald eagles need to live near water.
The bald eagle does not like to be near humans.
It is are found mostly in places where there are no humans, or very few of them.
A few bald eagles live in places with trees inside of big cities.
A family of bald eagles recently moved into Harlem, which is a place in the middle of New York city.[21]

### Eating whale carrion

It can move at speeds of 56–70 kilometers per hour (35–43 mph) when gliding or flapping its wings.
Eagles may eat a lot of carrion, especially in winter.
They will scavenge dead bodies up to the size of whales.
Eagles eat more large dead fish than whales.
They sometimes eat the leftover food from campsites or garbage dumps.
Healthy adult bald eagles are not eaten anywhere in the wild
This makes them thought as one of the top animals of the food chain.[27]

### Haliaeetus leucocephalus

Bald eagles become adults when they are four or five years old. When they are old enough to mate, they usually come back to the place where they were born.
In the early 1700s, the number of bald eagles were 300,000–500,000,[32] but by the 1950s there were only 412 nesting pairs in the United States.
DDT was completely banned in Canada in 1989.[35]
Because of all this hard work, the bald eagle's population began to rise again.
It was officially taken out from the United States list of endangered species on July 12, 1995.[36].
The bald eagle is the national bird of the United States.
The Continental Congress made the design for the Great Seal of the United States with a bald eagle holding thirteen arrows and an olive branch with thirteen leaves in its talons on June 20, 1782.[39][40]

### Seal of the President of the United States

The bald eagle can be found on both national seals and on the back of several coins. Between 1916 and 1945, the Flag of the President of the United States showed an eagle facing to its left.[41].
The Lakota people, for instance, give an eagle feather as a symbol of honor to a person who achieves a task.
The Pawnee people thought eagles as symbols of nature and fertility.
Native American tribes cannot use bald or golden eagle feathers for their religious or spiritual use anymore.
The eagle feather law usually defends Native Americans by providing many exceptions to wildlife laws, but it presently does not yet allow Native American tribes to use them yet.
This made the Native American groups angry because they insisted that it was stopping their ability to use their religion freely.[48][49]

## Study subjects

### 412 nesting pairs

- Female eagles laid eggs that were too weak to withstand the weight of its parents.[18]. ==In the early 1700s, the number of bald eagles were 300,000–500,000,[32] but by the 1950s there were only 412 nesting pairs in the United States==. Other things that stopped bald eagles from producing well was the loss of habitat and illegal hunting of bald eagles
